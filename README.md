## Up and running

Monorepo contains both the website and the CMS. Each has their own respective `package.json` configs ([sanity](/sanity/package.json), [website](/package.json)). The root `/package.json` has also been updated with the following `npm` scripts for Sanity:

| Command                     | Action                                           |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run sanity:install`    | Installs dependencies for Sanity                 |
| `npm run dev:sanity`        | Starts Sanity dev server at `localhost:3333`     |
| `npm run dev:sanity:deploy` | Deploys Sanity Studio on a `*.sanity.studio` URL |

        <p class="py-4 text-lg">We’re packing up this site and going all in on Urbit.</p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg">Why are we sold on it? We used it to build Landscape, an Urbit-native suite of apps for staying connected to our friends, family and colleagues. We use it on a daily basis. It’s clean and simple, intimate and inspiring.</p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg">Sure, there are hundreds of ways to communicate and collaborate online. This is the only one that’s entirely yours to own, customize and hold onto forever. </p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg">If you want to try it out or get in touch, join us on the Urbit network. It’s easier to join and use than ever before.</p>
        <p class="py-4 text-lg">Peace out,</p>

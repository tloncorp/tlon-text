We’ve all thought to ourselves Groups would be perfect if only my friends, family, and lovers were here. This was a difficult, nearly impossible feat. and we were all feeling a little lonely.

Until now - 

We at Tlon Corporation just released our new invite link feature.

So invite everyone you know, love, hate, adore to your favorite group. Or create your own group and invite your friends there…a more intimate online setting for convivial conversations. Start a family group, a friend group, and a study group. Finally, a place to call home, lounge, and library online.

You can invite ANYONE. They do NOT need to be on the network or have an Urbit ID.

This 'How to' is in two parts:

For hosts, Enable inviting
For members, Invite your friends
For all, Create a new group
Ok. Let’s get into it.


For Group Hosts, Enable Inviting - 

Invite links must be enabled by a group Host to surface an invite link that can be shared to those outside of the network. 

Inviting via Urbit ID (aka @p) is still enabled separately upon group creation and is dependent upon the groups privacy settings (private, secret, public.) 

Note: Once the invite link is enabled, anyone in your group, whether it is public, private, or secret, can invite anyone to your group using the generated group invite link. It is a binary ON / OFF feature. We plan to create more granular controls in the future.

 Go to your group settings.

Under ‘Set Privacy’ you’ll see a new section entitled ‘Invite someone from outside the Urbit network.’ Select the checkbox ‘Invite Link Enabled’

A note on privacy: Once enabled, depending upon your group privacy settings, members or admins will be able to view and share the invite link. For a public group, members and admins alike will be able to view and share the invite link. For secret and private groups, only the admin will be able to view and issue invite links.

 Copy + Share. That’s it! You and your entire community can now invite people to your community.

 Share Link

Share the link in a dm, email, tweet. Once your friend(s) click the link they’ll be able to go through the sign up flow below. It’s free and easy.

When your friend(s) click the link, they'll see an invite page like the one below.

For all, Create a New Group - 

Remember you don’t have to invite your knitting circle to Urmetica (although it's possible!) You can also create your own group.
